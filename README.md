##  Improving Reliability of Shotgun Proteomics with Machine Learning

<p align="justify"> The aim of this thesis is to improve the reliability of shotgun proteomics. Robust quantification of proteins is vital for understanding diseases and drug discovery. The large scale study of proteins suffers from yet not fully understood problems in accurate measurement of proteins. The thesis addresses the peptide detectability prediction as well as investigates the reasons for the poor reproducibility of proteomics experiments. It includes the background on deep learning for sequential modelling and a literature review of successful machine learning methodologies for proteomics data. Here we present an end-to-end ensemble of recurrent neural networks that can predict peptide detectability with high accuracy based on amino acid sequences. Our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on homo sapiens and mus musculus benchmark data sets. We also show that the model generalizes well across different species. Moreover, we disprove the hypothesis that the peptide distance from the protein centre impacts the reproducibility of shotgun proteomics experiments. The thesis also includes the comparison of different peptide encoding methods and connects peptide retention time to the reproducibility of mass spectrometry results. </p>
